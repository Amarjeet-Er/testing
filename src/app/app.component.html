          What is binding ? How many types of binding is there in Angular ? Explain with examples.
          <p>Ans:- <b>Binding</b> in Angular refers to the process of synchronizing data between the component
            (TypeScript/JavaScript code) and the view (HTML template). It allows you to display data dynamically in the
            view
            and respond to user input.</p>

          <p>Types of Binding in Angular </p>
          <p> There are four main types of binding in Angular:</p>

          <p>1. Interpolation (One-Way Data Binding):</p>
          <p>. Description: Displays data from the component in the view.</p>
          <p>. Example :- {{ Interpolation }}</p>

          <p>2. Property Binding (One-Way Data Binding):</p>
          <p>. Description: Binds data from the component to an HTML elementâ€™s property.</p>
          <p>. Example :- {{PropertyBinding}}</p>

          <p>3. Event Binding: </p>
          <p>. Description: Allows the component to respond to user actions (e.g., clicks).</p>
          <p>. Example :- {{Event}}</p>

          <p>4. Two-Way Data Binding: </p>
          <p>. Description: Combines property binding and event binding to keep the view and the component in sync. </p>
          <p>. Example :- {{TwoWay}}</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          What is Dependency Injection in Angular ?
          <p>Ans : - Dependency Injection (DI) in Angular is a design pattern where Angular provides and manages the
            services or objects that a class needs, rather than the class creating them itself.</p>
          <pre>. Example : - {{ Dependency }}</pre>
        </li>
      </ol>
